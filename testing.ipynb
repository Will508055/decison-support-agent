Just be careful while learning!Some bike upgrades can also make cornering easier. Make sure your bike has comfortable bars, dialed-in suspension, and consider using Luimoto’s tank grips to help your knees maintain more contact with the bike during curves.Mastering the art of cornering on a motorcycle is your ticket to more exhilarating rides—but taking curves also comes with risks, so you’ll need to build up your skills and confidence first. That’s why learning a few techniques and setting your bike up properly are essential before you start speeding through the twisties.'"
